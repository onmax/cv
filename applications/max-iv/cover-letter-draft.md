Dear MAX IV Software Team,

I am excited to apply for the Fullstack Web Developer position advertised on 15 September 2025. Over the past three years I have led and shipped data-intensive web platforms for Nimiq and the wider ecosystem, pairing Vue- and Nuxt-based frontends with operational automation that keeps global users informed in real time. The scale and mission of MAX IV resonate with the way I build software: close to users, grounded in reliability, and openly shared with the communities that depend on it.

At Nimiq I am the core maintainer for the public-facing Crypto Map (over 1,060 commits since October 2022) and the organization’s developer portal (755 commits). Both projects mirror MAX IV’s need for fast, accurate visualizations: I manage end-to-end pipelines that normalize heterogeneous data, validate submissions, and give stakeholders trustworthy dashboards. When validator operators needed richer telemetry, I extended Validators API (519 commits) with JSON-schema-validated feeds, role-based grids, and linting automation so support staff see the live state of the network without manual intervention.

Operational robustness is a through line in my work. I built and maintain the Nimiq changelog service that collates multi-repository activity, compares GPT-5 nano and GPT-4.1 summaries, and automatically delivers threaded Slack alerts—freeing the team from digging through 20+ repos before every release. The feedback intake platform I maintain (135 commits) stays production-ready because I lead dependency upgrades, TypeScript hardening, and UI fixes while coordinating with designers and QA. Those guardrails map directly to MAX IV’s expectations for CI/CD ownership, packaging, and support-rotation handovers.

I am accustomed to cross-institution collaboration. My contributions stretch beyond the Nimiq org into community tooling such as Unocss preset libraries (176 commits), Nuxt ecosystem packages, and the Cryptocity open-data initiative. These experiences honed my ability to work across teams, respect upstream conventions, and document work transparently—traits you highlighted as essential for a research-driven environment.

I am fluent in JavaScript and TypeScript, and I am currently curating a Python-focused project to demonstrate my backend expertise [[Add Python project example + impact]]. In parallel, I am compiling recent Infrastructure-as-Code work (Helm charts, Ansible playbooks, Kubernetes deployments) to map one-to-one with your stack [[Add IaC example or confirm non-applicability]]. I am ready to bring the same discipline I apply to blockchain infrastructure to your synchrotron services, and I am excited to learn MAX IV-specific platforms like SciCat, Taranta, and DUO.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience delivering production-grade dashboards, automation, and documentation can accelerate the mission at MAX IV. I am available immediately and can adapt to your preferred support rotation.

Kind regards,

Máximo García
