Dear MAX IV Software Team,

I am excited to apply for the Fullstack Web Developer position advertised on 15 September 2025. Over the past three years I have led and shipped data-intensive web platforms for Nimiq and the wider ecosystem, pairing Vue- and Nuxt-based frontends with automation that keeps global users informed in real time. The scale and mission of MAX IV resonate with the way I build software: close to users, grounded in reliability, and openly shared with the communities that depend on it.

At Nimiq I am the core maintainer for the public-facing Crypto Map (1,060+ commits since October 2022) and the developer portal (755 commits). Both projects mirror MAX IV’s need for fast, accurate visualizations: I manage pipelines that normalize 30,000+ merchant locations, pre-cluster data at build time, and deliver lightweight map payloads so stakeholders get instant feedback. When validator operators needed richer telemetry, I extended Validators API (519 commits) with a Cloudflare-backed scoring engine that samples the blockchain on a schedule, runs the ranking algorithm I designed, and surfaces the results through Nuxt dashboards.

Operational robustness is a through line in my work. I built and maintain the Nimiq changelog service that collates multi-repository activity, compares GPT-5 nano and GPT-4.1 summaries, and automatically delivers threaded Slack alerts—freeing the team from digging through 20+ repos before every release. I also keep legacy systems such as the nine-year-old Nimiq Wallet healthy, introducing modern tooling without breaking user flows, and I drive design-system efforts (CSS/UnoCSS libraries) that make new interfaces consistent and accessible.

I am accustomed to cross-institution collaboration. My contributions stretch beyond the Nimiq org into community tooling such as UnoCSS presets (176 commits), Nuxt ecosystem packages, and the Cryptocity open-data initiative. Recently I have owned end-to-end and unit testing for an internal FastAPI + PostgreSQL service at Mimic—hardening the suite around Qt Rant workflows—even though my day-to-day production work remains TypeScript-centric. That mix has honed my ability to partner with diverse teams, respect upstream conventions, and document work transparently.

While my primary expertise is JavaScript and TypeScript, I bring practical exposure to Python through university projects and the current FastAPI test efforts, and I am motivated to deepen that experience under the mentorship of your Software team. I am equally eager to contribute to your infrastructure-as-code workflows (Helm, Kubernetes, Ansible) by applying the operational discipline I use to run Nimiq’s Cloudflare and Workers stack. Platforms like SciCat, Taranta, DUO, and ISPyB are areas I look forward to learning so I can translate scientific requirements into resilient web products.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience delivering production-grade dashboards, automation, and documentation can accelerate the mission at MAX IV. I am available immediately and can adapt to your preferred support rotation.

Kind regards,

Máximo García
