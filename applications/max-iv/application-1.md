**Your team  **At MAX IV, the Technical Division builds and supports the technologies that enable cutting-edge research, while continuously improving how the facility operates. Within this division, the Software team develops and maintains the control systems, data acquisition software, and user interfaces that researchers rely on every day. We focus on increasing functionality and reliability across the facility to meet the demands of world-class science. We provide laboratory wide software solutions following international standards in synchrotrons, such as data acquisition, control system, web-based user interfaces, distributed hardware control, scanning tools for running experiments, and metadata harvesting, to meet the continuously evolving research requirements.  We work on projects towards FAIR data, providing a storage infrastructure along with analysis tools for researchers to work on their data after their experiments. We also develop and operate services towards the operation of the whole facility, such as proposal and scheduling systems, electronic logging, diagnostic dashboards, and maintenance support systems. You will join an open and friendly team of 20 developers of diverse backgrounds, where continuous improvement and mentorship is part of our DNA.
