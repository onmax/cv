## Overview
Custom VitePress-powered DX hub with live playgrounds, widget panels, and automated API docs for the Nimiq ecosystem.

## Responsibilities
- Role: Core Maintainer & Frontend Engineer (Nimiq)
- Category: nimiq
- Timeline: 2023-10-23 -> 2025-06-07 (1y 7m)
- Stack: Vue 3 · VitePress · custom `nimiq-vitepress-theme` · UnoCSS · Typedoc · OpenRPC ingestion · Slack feedback integrations
- Ownership: authored the design system and layout, built reusable widget slots for interactive tools, wired automated docs pipelines (OpenRPC, Typedoc), and maintained related DX properties (`nimiq-ui`, starter kits, feedback hub, tutorial site).

## Highlights
- **Custom theme system**: Replaced default VitePress UI with a fully bespoke theme (inspired by Fumadocs) that introduces widget zones, icon explorers, and GPT-helper slots—unlocking components the stock theme couldn’t support.
- **Interactive tooling**: Embedded RPC playgrounds, icon browsers, and copy-to-code snippets using teleport-based widgets so developers can test APIs and pull UI assets without leaving docs.
- **Automated references**: Pipelined web-client Typedoc output and OpenRPC specs directly from source repos, keeping API docs synced with every release and eliminating manual rebuilds.
- **Feedback loop**: Shipped a cross-product Slack-powered feedback widget that files GitHub issues automatically, cutting triage time and giving immediate signal to Nimiq Pay and other teams.
- **DX ecosystem**: Coordinated `nimiq-ui` (design tokens, VitePress theme), starter templates, tutorial content, and the upcoming Nuxt layout to provide a coherent path from docs → samples → production apps.

## Impact
- Improved doc discoverability and developer sentiment through the custom layout—early testing shows faster navigation to key guides and positive qualitative feedback from community channels.
- Reduced doc maintenance overhead by auto-syncing API references from code, turning previously manual updates into zero-touch releases.
- Accelerated support turnaround as feedback submissions now land directly in GitHub, letting maintainers respond like a small startup despite a lean team.
- Empowered external builders with cohesive tooling: docs, UI kits, starters, and tutorials share tokens and component patterns, making the DX team the go-to resource for integrating the Nimiq web client.
