## Overview
Feedback platform consisting of an embeddable widget and Nuxt-backed intake APIs that forward curated reports to GitHub and Slack.

## Responsibilities
- Role: Senior Contributor (Nimiq)
- Category: nimiq
- Timeline: 2025-05-14 -> 2025-09-24 (4m)
- Stack: Nuxt 3 路 Vite widget bundle 路 Drizzle ORM 路 Cloudflare Workers edge delivery 路 Slack/GitHub automations
- Ownership: designed the widget UX, implemented deferred loading and event APIs, built the backend service that triages submissions into GitHub issues + Slack alerts, and rolled the system out to Developer Center, Nimiq Pay, Tutorials, and internal dashboards.

## Highlights
- **Widget architecture**: shipped a themable feedback widget with programmatic control, form analytics, and multilingual support that apps can mount with one script tag.
- **Automated triage**: integrated Nuxt backend with GitHub REST API and Slack webhooks so every submission creates an actionable issue and pings the right channel without human routing.
- **Performance & cost**: introduced lazy CSS/JS loading, Cloudflare caching, and test modes so product teams can embed the widget with <10 KB critical path and zero accidental alerts.
- **Cross-app reuse**: packaged the widget and backend for reuse across Developer Center, Tutorials, Pay, and Wallet panels, establishing a single DX feedback loop.

## Impact
- Enabled a lean DX team to capture product feedback directly in GitHub, reducing manual triage and giving near-real-time visibility to maintainers.
- Standardized the way Nimiq web properties collect bugs and ideas, letting teams spin up feedback channels in minutes instead of custom forms per app.
- Provided telemetry hooks (events, tags) that reveal trending issues by product without investing in a third-party tool.
