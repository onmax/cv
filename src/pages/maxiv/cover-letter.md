Dear Mirjam Lindberg,

I am writing to express my interest in the full-stack web developer position. My name is Maximo Garcia. As a developer with seven years' experience, I have gained extensive knowledge and skills working in both the front and back ends. I have summarised the tasks I have performed in my current and previous roles below.

At Nimiq, I operate the Validators API, a Python- and TypeScript-driven platform that ingests 720 blockchain batches every 12 hours, validates telemetry, and powers user-facing dashboards. I have also led a four-hour hotfix and a 48-hour permanent fix, restoring missing epochs and adding rate limiting and dependency audits. I have also integrated automated tests with GitHub Actions to ensure consistent security gates across over 20 repositories. The same stack underpins our Nuxt-based Crypto Map, where Python ingestion keeps over 33,000 locations current and improved observability reduces our team's incident response time. Previously, at LACChain/Alastria (Inetum), I co-designed security and privacy specifications, translating research into actionable standards with international partners. This experience has honed my ability to align engineers and non-engineers around clear metadata and access requirements — skills that I would bring to MAX IV's cataloguing and dashboarding services.

Thriving in collaborative environments, I am an easy-going and adaptable person. I write executable documentation, participate in support rotations, and work with Linux-first tooling, CI/CD, Docker Compose, and the Cloudflare ecosystem. I adhere to web security best practices and am comfortable learning additional infrastructure tooling as required. I am also learning Swedish (A1 level) so that I can contribute more fully on site.

I am excited by MAX IV's mission to enable world-class X-ray science and by the prospect of enhancing the software group's web services for daily facility operations, allowing researchers to focus on discovery. I would welcome the chance to talk about how I could contribute to delivering resilient, secure and user-centred web services at MAX IV. My CV and code samples are available upon request.

Kind regards,
Máximo García
