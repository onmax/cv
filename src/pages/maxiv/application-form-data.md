## Application Questions

**11. Please motivate why you are interested in this position.**

I am excited by MAX IV's mission to enable world-class X-ray science and by the prospect of enhancing the software group's web services for daily facility operations, allowing researchers to focus on discovery. The position aligns perfectly with my experience in building and maintaining data-driven platforms that serve scientific and technical users. At Nimiq, I've operated the Validators API—a Python and TypeScript platform processing blockchain telemetry every 12 hours—and maintained the Crypto Map with over 33,000 locations. This hands-on experience with full-stack development, real-time data pipelines, and operational monitoring directly translates to MAX IV's needs.

I'm particularly drawn to the collaborative, DevOps-oriented team culture, the opportunity to work on legacy and modern systems alike, and the chance to participate in international software framework collaborations. Having co-designed security specifications at LACChain/Alastria, I understand the importance of translating complex technical requirements into maintainable, documented solutions. I'm also learning Swedish to contribute more fully on-site, demonstrating my commitment to integrating into the local environment. This role represents an ideal combination of technical challenge, meaningful impact on scientific research, and professional growth in an international research setting.

**12. How many years of professional programming experience in Python and/or JavaScript do you have?**

7 years

**13. Do you have experience developing frontend applications using modern frameworks?**

✓ Yes

I have extensive experience with Vue, Nuxt, and related modern frontend frameworks. I've built and maintained the Nimiq Developer Center, Crypto Map frontend, Validators API dashboard, and multiple web applications using Nuxt 3, Vue 3, TypeScript, and modern tooling (Vite, Vitest, UnoCSS, Tailwind CSS).

**14. Are you comfortable working in a Linux/Unix environment?**

✓ Yes

I work daily in Linux environments for development, deployment, and operational tasks. All my projects run on Linux-based infrastructure (Cloudflare Workers, Docker containers, GitHub Actions runners), and I'm comfortable with shell scripting, package management, and system administration tasks.

**15. Are you familiar with basic web application security concepts?**

✓ Yes

I implement and enforce security best practices across 20+ repositories, including rate limiting, dependency auditing, secret hygiene checks, input validation, and secure API design. I've built GDPR-compliant identity services and contributed to W3C-aligned security specifications for blockchain identity systems.

**16. Do you have a basic understanding of how different types of databases work (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc), and experience writing basic queries?**

✓ Yes

I work extensively with PostgreSQL (via Supabase and Drizzle ORM), including PostGIS for geospatial queries. I write complex SQL queries for data ingestion, joins, aggregations, and optimization. I'm familiar with both relational (PostgreSQL) and document-based databases, and understand indexing, query planning, and performance tuning fundamentals.

**17. Do you have some awareness of tools used for infrastructure-as-code, deployment, or containerization, such as Ansible, Helm, or Docker?**

✓ Yes

I use Docker Compose for local development and containerization, GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines, and Cloudflare infrastructure tooling for deployment. While I have more experience with Docker and modern cloud deployment platforms than Ansible/Helm specifically, I'm comfortable learning new infrastructure tooling and have successfully automated deployments for multiple production services.
