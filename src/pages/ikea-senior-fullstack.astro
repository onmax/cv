## Profile

Senior fullstack engineer with 6+ years designing low-latency web platforms, data pipelines, and developer tooling. I specialise in TypeScript/Nuxt, Node.js, Supabase/PostgreSQL, Cloudflare, and CI/CD automation. My recent work focuses on migrating monolithic stacks to modular, event-aware services, introducing feedback loops that keep operations lean, and shipping reliable experiences trusted by global user bases. I thrive in cross-functional teams, translate product requirements into resilient architecture, and drive initiatives end-to-end—from discovery and UX prototyping to observability and rollout.

## IKEA Fit Highlights

- **Legacy to service-centric**: Led the Crypto Map rewrite from a tightly coupled Vue SPA into a monorepo of independently deployable services (Nuxt UI, Supabase Edge Functions, Slack bots). Reduced initial load time from >10 s to ~4 s while introducing dataset toggles that enable side-by-side cutovers—experience directly applicable to decomposing IKEA's customer returns monoliths.
- **Complex integrations**: Engineered the Validators API platform, orchestrating hourly blockchain ingestions, Slack alerting, and REST endpoints consumed by wallets and partner dashboards. Demonstrated ability to stitch heterogeneous systems into cohesive, reliable journeys.
- **DevOps ownership**: Built automated release pipelines (GitHub Actions, pnpm workspaces) for 50+ open-source packages; operate four parallel environments (preview/prod × mainnet/testnet) with confidence.
- **Outcome-driven UX**: Delivered embeddable feedback widgets, RPC playgrounds, and icon explorers that transformed passive documentation into interactive tools, increasing developer task completion and reducing support wait time.
- **Global mindset**: Remote-first collaboration across Europe, Americas, and Asia; comfortable aligning with stakeholders in product, support, logistics, and compliance. Fluent in Spanish and English, conversational in Swedish.

## Technical Skills

- **Languages & Frameworks**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Vue 3, Nuxt, Node.js, Go (prototyping), Python, React.
- **Backend & Data**: Supabase/PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Drizzle ORM, REST/GraphQL APIs, Cloudflare Workers/Queues, WebSockets, cron pipelines.
- **DevOps & Quality**: GitHub Actions, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Docker, automated testing (Vitest, Jest, Playwright basics), observability via custom Slack reporting.
- **Architecture**: Event-driven data ingestion, micro frontends, performance optimisation, caching strategies, schema validation (Valibot, JSON Schema).
- **Tooling & Collaboration**: pnpm monorepos, Storybook/Histoire, VitePress, Figma co-design, Slack/Linear for async coordination.

## Professional Experience

### Frontend / Fullstack Engineer — Nimiq (Remote)
*Jan 2022 – Present*
- Transitioned Crypto Map's legacy stack into a service-oriented architecture: Supabase/PostGIS functions for geospatial queries, Cloudflare cron workers for cluster computation, reusable Nuxt-based UIs, and a Slack moderation bot. Enabled non-technical staff to publish new datasets in minutes and keep data fresh for 29k+ locations.
- Delivered the Validators API, a TypeScript service syncing ~720 blockchain batches per epoch. Added automated Slack alerts, retry logic, and dataset "preview → prod" toggles that mirror the controlled rollouts IKEA expects across markets.
- Built the company's developer experience platform (Developer Center) with a bespoke VitePress theme, interactive widgets, and continuous document generation from OpenRPC/Typedoc sources—keeping stakeholders aligned without manual updates.
- Created a cross-product feedback platform (web widget + Nuxt backend) that funnels customer signals into GitHub and Slack. Reduced triage friction and provided telemetry tags to prioritise fixes.
- Managed release pipelines and quality for 50+ open-source packages (\`nimiq-ui\`, \`nimiq-css\`, \`albatross-rpc-client-ts\`, starter kits), ensuring downstream teams receive timely, backwards-compatible updates.

### SSI Researcher & Fullstack Developer — LACChain/Alastria (Inetum)
*Aug 2020 – Dec 2021*
- Built identity services with Spring Boot microservices, TypeScript frontends, and blockchain communication libraries, complying with GDPR and W3C standards.
- Introduced automated deployment workflows (Docker, nginx) and mentored junior developers on code reviews and best practices.

### Freelance Engineer — Various Clients
*Jan 2017 – Apr 2021*
- Delivered web applications for universities and NGOs, including multi-tenant conference tooling and e-commerce operations, balancing rapid iteration with maintainability.

## Why IKEA

IKEA's ambition to reinvent customer returns through modern, event-driven platforms aligns with the problems I solve daily—decomposing legacy flows, building reliable integration layers, and empowering teams with autonomous tooling. I am excited to bring my experience modernising data-heavy services, crafting delightful UX, and scaling developer workflows to IKEA's Customer Returns domain to improve both co-worker efficiency and customer trust.
