## Overview
Interactive browser-based curriculum that teaches the Nimiq Web Client with zero local setup, powered by WebContainer workspaces and live blockchain connections.

## Responsibilities
- Role: Senior Contributor (Nimiq)
- Category: nimiq
- Timeline: 2025-06-07 -> 2025-07-24 (1m)
- Stack: Astro · TutorialKit · Vue 3 components · WebContainer sandboxes · UnoCSS · Nimiq Web Client integrations
- Ownership: architected the lesson flow, authored code-along content, embedded wallet/testnet utilities, wired the feedback widget, and aligned tutorials with Developer Center guides and starter templates.

## Highlights
- **Zero-install playground**: configured TutorialKit + WebContainer so learners get a full filesystem, terminal, and Nimiq node connection directly in the browser.
- **Blockchain exercises**: built guided flows for wallet creation, transactions, staking, and HTLCs that hit real testnet endpoints with safety guards.
- **DX integrations**: reused `nimiq-ui` components and the feedback widget to give consistent styling and instant issue reporting across the DX portfolio.
- **SEO & content ops**: optimized Astro build, added metadata, and automated deployment scripts so new chapters publish with a single command.

## Collaboration
- Issues: open: 4, closed: 5
- Sample Issues:
  - Remove seed nodes? (open): https://github.com/nimiq/tutorial/issues/11
  - Add link to cards (open): https://github.com/nimiq/tutorial/issues/10
  - explain consensus head change (open): https://github.com/nimiq/tutorial/issues/8

## Impact
- Lowered the entry barrier for Nimiq builders—learners can complete end-to-end blockchain tasks without installing tooling.
- Created a reusable curriculum that complements the Developer Center and starter kits, giving support teams a canonical resource to share.
- Tightened the feedback loop for educational content; issues raised in tutorials now land directly in GitHub, accelerating fixes and lesson updates.
