## Support & Reliability
- Acts as go-to responder for Nimiq validators API, public website, CryptoPub, and related tooling when incidents arise.
- Mid-2025: resolved a stakingrewards.com report about non-elected validators missing from trust-score dataâ€”shipped a hotfix in under four hours and replayed epochs to deliver a permanent fix inside 48 hours with zero downtime.

## Delivery & Quality Practices
- Treats GitHub Actions as a release gate across maintained repos; lint, type-check, and targeted test suites must pass before merging.
- Adds lightweight Vitest coverage to new critical paths to guard against regressions while keeping maintenance overhead low.
- Builds internal libraries and templates (design tokens, tooling presets, monorepo scaffolds) to speed delivery while enforcing shared standards.

## Data & Python Usage
- Uses Python 3 monthly for Crypto Map data refreshes: parsing partner CSVs, running Google Business API harvesters, and performing quick analytics/OCR transformations.
- Leverages standard-library modules plus ad-hoc scripts to generate datasets and marketing performance snapshots without large frameworks.

## Deployment Stack Familiarity
- Day-to-day deployments run on Cloudflare (Workers, Pages, D1) paired with Docker-ised Postgres/Supabase environments for local validation.
- Comfortable with Docker Compose for reproducing database integrations; has not yet required Kubernetes/Helm in production.
