# MAX IV Application Follow-ups

- [ ] Summarise the FastAPI + PostgreSQL testing work (scope, coverage, tooling) so we can represent your current Python involvement accurately on the tailored CV page.
- [ ] Review the missing personal repositories with >=5 commits (e.g. `onmax/content`, `onmax/consola`, `onmax/cv`, `onmax/core-rs-albatross`, `onmax/h3`, `onmax/nuxt`, `onmax/ungh`, `onmax/vitepress`) and confirm which ones should be added to `src/data/projects-data.ts` with role/impact summaries.
- [ ] Share outcomes/metrics for operations tooling (Slack automations, support rotations, incident workflows) so we can replace generic statements in the MAX IV focus areas with concrete numbers (response time reductions, number of teams served, etc.).
- [ ] Confirm any exposure to MAX IV-adjacent platforms (SciCat, Taranta, DUO, ISPyB) or equivalent research data systems so we can mention them explicitly if applicable.
- [ ] Provide notable infrastructure efforts (e.g. Helm charts, Kubernetes deployments, Ansible playbooks, monitoring/alerts) to better align the cover letter and CV with the roleâ€™s DevOps expectations.
